Your task is to build a model to predict fast growth of firms using the bisnode-firms data we used in class.
•	You should design the target (fast growth), it can be measured in any way you like over one (2013 vs 2012) or two years (2014 vs 2012).
•	You need to argue for your choice, discussing a few alternatives, maybe 2-3 paragraphs using concepts and ideas from corporate finance.
•	Build three different models and pick the one you like the most.
•	Should include at least one logit and one random forest.

Data management, sample design
•	The dataset is very close to what you saw in seminar.
•	But you need to start with the panel for 2010-2015.
•	Two pieces of code, sample design and prediction:
o	ch17-firm-exit-data-prep.
o	ch17-predicting-firm-exit.
•	On the sample, you can make changes, but do not need to.
________________________________________
Features
•	You may use similar variables and features we used for exit prediction.
•	You may do differently.
•	Look at descriptives, lowess, tabulate factors, make decisions.

Tasks 1
PART I: Probability prediction
•	Predict probabilities.
•	Look at cross-validated performance and pick your favorite model.
PART II: Classification
•	Think about the business problem, and define your loss function (like FP=X dollars, FN=Y dollars).
•	For each model:
o	Predict probabilities.
o	Look for the optimal classification threshold.
o	Calculate expected loss with your loss function.
o	Pick the model that has the smallest average (over 5 folds) expected loss.
PART III: Discussion of results
•	Show a confusion table (on a selected fold or holdout set).
•	Discuss results, evaluate how useful your model may be.

Tasks 2
•	There are two industry categories in the dataset: manufacturing and services (repair, accommodation, food).
•	Define a single loss function, but carry out the exercise for two groups separately.
•	Pick a prediction model, carry out classification for manufacturing and then repeat for services.
•	Compare the model performance across two samples
